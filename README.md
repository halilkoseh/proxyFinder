Proxy Finder

Proxy Finder is a Python application designed to help you find and test proxy servers effortlessly. Leveraging web scraping, it provides a reliable list of proxies for various use cases.

To get started, clone the repository using git clone <repository-url> and navigate into the project directory with cd proxyFinder. Set up a virtual environment by running python3 -m venv venv and activate it using source venv/bin/activate on Linux/Mac or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows. Install the required dependencies by running pip install mysql-connector-python.

Once set up, activate the virtual environment (if not already activated) using source /path/to/proxyFinder/venv/bin/activate and run the script with python proxyList.py. Follow the on-screen instructions to search for and test proxy servers.
